# Booting

Flux is intended to be booted using Limine (or a Limine-compatible) bootloader. Refer to [https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine/blob/trunk/PROTOCOL.md] for detailed information about that bootloaders specification, and importantly for us, the state that it leaves the computer in when our kernel takes control.
